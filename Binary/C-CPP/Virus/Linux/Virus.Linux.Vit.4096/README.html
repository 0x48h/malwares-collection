This is the accompying source to the UNIX ELF PARASITES AND VIRUS paper
which should be read prior to compiling the source.  The actual virus does not
compile into infected host form.  Manual infection methods are required using
the infect-elf-p program provided - the actual paper is the definitive source
on how to do this.

COMPILATION

To compile the source:

'make all'

To remove compile time files produced, ie executables etc.

'make clean'

RUNNING THE PROGRAMS

live-virus-be-warned is a precompiled version of the virus.  Producing the
initial virus requires manual intervention - see the paper.

COMPILE TIME SELECTION OF PARASITE CODE

To use your own parasite code, simply remove the symbol link parasite.c and
relink it to your own code.  Your parasite code must declare the variables
parasite (char []), hentry (long), entry (long), plength (int).  Refer to the
paper on what these do, or look at parasite-dummy.c for a simple but functional
parasite.
