 It is not a dangerous memory resident encrypted parasitic virus. It hooks
 INT 21h, then writes itself to the end of COM and EXE files that are
 executed or opened. The virus contains the text strings:

 !#TEMP#!
 REQUEST.IVA
 RECEIPT.IVA
 CALLFAST.COM

 I am the man that walks alone
 And when I'm walking a dark road
 At night or strolling through the park
 When the light begins to change
 I sometimes feel a little strange
 A little anxious when it's dark

 While opening any ZIP file the virus scans the contents of the ZIP file for
 the REQUEST.IVA file. If there is no such one inside of ZIP, the virus
 creates the CALLFAST.COM file, writes into there the video-effect routine,
 infects CALLFAST.COM and appends that file to the files stored in ZIP.

 So the virus "infects" ZIP file, after "infection" the ZIP file contains
 infected copy of the virus.

 If there is the REQUEST.IVA file in the ZIP, and that file is of the special
 format (there is ID-string 92h,14h,76h,17h, and there is one or more file
 search pattern) the virus creates RECEIPT.IVA file, searches for the files
 are listed in the REQUEST.IVA file, copies them into RECEIPT.IVA, encrypts
 the result, and stores it into the ZIP.

 So the virus is able to "stole" the files from the computer and save them
 into the ZIP containing special REQUEST.IVA file.

 While processing the ZIP files the virus does not call PKZIP/PKUNZIP
 utilities, but parses by itself the internal ZIP format, reads/writes the
 ZIP records and adds new ones. While writing new data into the ZIP files the
 virus does not use compression, but writes it in not compressed form (ZIP
 method "stored").

 The virus dropper (the CALLFAST.COM file) contains the routine witch
 displays when executed:
