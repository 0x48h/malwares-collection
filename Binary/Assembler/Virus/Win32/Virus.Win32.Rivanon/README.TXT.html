This package contains the source code of RIVANON virus and the include files
used to compile it. The binaries included are those of a debug version. The
debug version infects only files called 'x.exe'. Anyway, if you want to test,
that's run this virus, better to compile the source code and not rely on the
binaries, an error can't be excluded and the binaries could be those of the
infectious version!

To compile this source code you need to get FASM, an open source assembler
easily available on the web.

The include files provided are needed and aren't, for most of them, included
in the FASM assembler package.</span></div></body>
