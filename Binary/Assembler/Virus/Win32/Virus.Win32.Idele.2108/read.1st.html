               IDELE virus version 1.9 July-December 2000


Description:

This is a per-process encrypted virus. It uses a new EPO (*) technic 
(as far i know), nothing is modified in the host code part.

The virus searchs targets on C:,D:,E:,F: drives when ever those drives are
accessible.

The virus works fine on Win9x/Win nt4 platforms, but don't work
on Win 2k platform.

This virus is undetected at the time it was completed,
yet it's not destructive, but it's a computer virus so use it at your own
risks ! 

I can't be held as responsible for use/misuse of this program.
This program was only designed for research aims.

(Is fire guns dealers can be held also as responsible for the death of 
a young guy somewhere in the world when someone uses a machine gun 
to kill him ?)
