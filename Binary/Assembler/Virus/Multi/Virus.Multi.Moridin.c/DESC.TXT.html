              Security-pack#1 (Backdoor/Virus)
    ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ
 
   Welcome to the first release of my security package. First
   of all let me explain the usage of it. It was NOT compiled
   for any illegal use! You may only use those tools on a
   restricted system/lab computers that have no other contact with the
   outside. I, the author of the virus can't be held responsible
   for your actions.
 
   The security package could be used to monitor the spread of an highly
   sophisticated network virus and see how well your defence
   against this kind of viruses/worms are. As the virus will
   propagate in a large number of ways, I highly recommend that
   you run the virus on computers only connected to computers you
   want to be exposed to the virus. On those systems in your network
   you want clean create the file "c:\_vac.txt" to make immune. To monitor
   the spread of the virus you can use the client side of the backdoor.
   Simply connect to the computers you think might be infected and
   send a message to them to confirm. In some cases the computer must
   restart after infection (over LAN), unless you click the "infected"
   drive in "This Computer" which also will active the virus.

   The password of the .ZIP containing the binaries is "barrier",
   use the files on your own risk! The virus has no destructive
   payloads and has been highly bug tested, but I can't say for sure
   that it won't corrupt files under any conditions. It works fine on
   the systems I tested it on, but who knows after all it's a program :)

   Using the client of la backdoor :

   client /&lt;ip or host name&gt; /&lt;argument&gt;

   arguments:

   /m &lt;message&gt;   Sends a message to the infected system
   /u &lt;path&gt;      Uploads/Executes a file on infected system
   /c             Open/close CD
   /x             Close server (temporary)

   example: client /111.111.111.112 /u c:\autoexec.bat
   or     : client /asmodeus /m How are you?

   FAQ:

   Q. How do I infect just one sample file?

   A. It can be done, but it's a bit tricky... But if you follow my
      intructions everything will go just fine. First put the file
      you want to infect in a newly created directory. Then copy
      the binary of the virus to the same directory.
      run the virus binary, then immediately execute the undo.reg
      script to remove the virus from "execution flow", then manually
      delete all the dropper files created in windows and system directory.
      they are as follows :

      C:\&lt;windows&gt;\system\mmsystem.bin
      C:\&lt;windows&gt;\system\packed.exe
      C:\&lt;windows&gt;\system\advapi33.exe
      C:\&lt;windows&gt;\system\commdlg.vbs
      
      Also delete all normal.dot on your system, finaly enter registry
      editor (regedit.exe) remove all entries with a .vbs exstension
      from HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run

      Now the virus should be removed completly from your system and
      only reside in file you just infected.
     
   Q. Is win32.moridin compatible with win2k?

   A. It has been tested on win2k pro ver.2195 (general public release),
      and works fine. It has also been tested on win95 (first and second
      edition) as well as win98. Should work on NT 4.0 as well.

   Q. What is the features of win32.moridin?

   A. Read appendix A.
